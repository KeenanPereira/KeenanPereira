# Data Analysis, AI, and Machine Learning

Welcome to my repository focused on Data Analysis, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML)! In this repository, I'll be documenting my journey as I dive 
into the exciting world of data-driven technologies, particularly focusing on linear regression algorithms at the moment.

## About Me
I'm a passionate learner enthusiastic about data and its transformative potential. Exploring the realms of AI and ML has become my latest endeavor,
and I'm currently dedicating time to understand linear regression algorithms.

## Repository Contents
Here's what you can find in this repository:

- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks where I experiment with various datasets, implement  algorithms from scratch, and utilize popular libraries for practical implementations.
- **Code Snippets**: This section includes code snippets and scripts related to data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. 
- **Visualizations**: Visual representations of data, model outputs, and insights gained during the learning process. A picture is worth a thousand words, after all!

## Linear Regression Algorithms
Currently, my primary focus is on mastering linear regression algorithms. Linear regression is a fundamental technique in the world of machine learning, allowing us to model relationships between variables and make predictions. I'm studying:

- **Simple Linear Regression**: Understanding the basic concept of fitting a line to data points.
  
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Exploring scenarios where multiple predictors influence the outcome.
  
- **Polynomial Regression**: Extending linear regression to model nonlinear relationships using polynomial functions.
  
- **Regularization Techniques**: Learning how techniques like Lasso and Ridge regression can mitigate overfitting in linear models.

## Get in Touch
I'm excited to connect with fellow learners, data enthusiasts, and professionals in the field. If you have any suggestions, insights, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out to me(www.linkedin.com/in/keenan-pereira-15823824b).

Let's learn, grow, and transform the world with data together! ðŸš€ðŸ“ŠðŸ¤–

Happy coding!
